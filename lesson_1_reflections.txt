How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug thatf
was introduced?

It really helped me as the file was too long to find the typo.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

efficient programmer in the long term?

Thats very useful as if there is a bug because of typo for example I can detect it easily and save a lot of time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros: Reduces the number of versions to be commited as I can decide only when it is essential to commit
    The cons: 1- your judgement when to commit maybe not correct so you can end up having a big bug in the application
              2- You can forget to commit.  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is usually related to programming codes so one file may affect other files as well.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can get to a working version at anytime

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want use it for all my projects
